# React Demo App

This app queries the TMDB API's "Discovery" endpoint, displaying a list
of movies that can be added to a watchlist. The user can add or remove movies
from their watchlist.

The README generated by `create-react-app` can be found
[here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
It's definitely worth reading!

## Running this application

Download or clone this repo, then run `yarn install` or `npm install`,
depending on which you use (I used Yarn).

You will need a [TMDB API key](https://www.themoviedb.org). They are free.

You can hard code your API key in the App.js file, or pass it in as an
environment variable by running `env REACT_APP_API_KEY=yourAPIKey` before all
of your commands (at least on Linux and macOS).

`yarn start` or `npm start` runs the development server.

Happy hacking!
